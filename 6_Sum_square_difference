The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.



function square(num) {
    var sum = 0;
    var sum1 = 0;
    var a;
      for(var i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
        sum += Math.pow(i, 2);
        sum1 += i;
        a = Math.pow(sum1, 2);
      }
    
    return a - sum;
}
square(100);
